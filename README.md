# Falcon9-landing-prediction
we will predict if the Falcon 9 will land successfully. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch.
